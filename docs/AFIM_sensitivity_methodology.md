# Methodology: Antarctic (Land)Fast (Sea) Ice Modelling and Metrics

This document describes the core methodologies implemented in the AFIM (Antarctic Fast Ice Modelling) framework, corresponding to functions and constructs in the repository [`src/`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/tree/main/src).

When classifying fast ice from numerical model sea ice simulation results, it is common practice to use sea ice concentration (`aice`) and sea ice speed (`ispd`). The former is a tracer variable derived on the spatial grid centre (commonly referred to as the /T-grid/). In contrast, `ispd` is derived from the momentum components (`u`, `v`), which are defined at displaced locations relative to the /T-grid/, forming what is referred to as the Arakawa /B-grid/. [This figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpath2o/AFIM/main/docs/figures/bgrid.png) shows a depiction of the computational [Arakawa B-grid](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-460817-7.50009-4) in the vicinity of an island. Note that in this depiction, only one grid cell has been masked out as land. This is important, as it motivates the classification strategy: due to computational constraints, a no-slip boundary is imposed on any velocity cell adjacent to land (i.e., touching land). These velocity components are explicitly set to $0$ by the model. Velocity is defined on staggered /B-grid/ locations, this results in cells near the coast having artificially zero speed regardless of the physical ice state. This introduces ambiguity: a zero speed may result either from a valid physical condition (e.g., grounded ice) or from an imposed boundary condition.

In [CICE v6](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE), the momentum equation evolves horizontal velocity components ($u$, $v$) under various forces:

$$
\rho h \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} = \vec{\tau}_a + \vec{\tau}_o - mf\hat{z} \times \vec{u} - mg\nabla H + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} - C_d \vec{u}
$$

Where:
- $\vec{u}$ is ice velocity
- $\vec{\tau}_a$, $\vec{\tau}_o$ are wind and ocean stresses
- $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $g$ is gravity
- $H$ is surface height
- $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the internal ice stress tensor
- $C_d$ is the drag coefficient

In mathematical terms, the ice speed is computed as:

$$
|\vec{u}| = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}
$$

But near land, either $u = 0$, $v = 0$, or both are imposed, and so $|\vec{u}| = 0$ even though ice may not be landfast. Because of this, AFIM implements multiple strategies to mitigate false classifications near land by using interpolated speeds or spatially averaged approaches (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2**.

## 1. Primary Classification

A grid cell is classified as fast ice if:

$$
a \geq a_\text{thresh} \quad \text{and} \quad |\vec{u}| \leq u_\text{thresh}
$$

where:
* $a_\text{thresh} = 0.15$ (**sea ice concentration threshold**)
* $u_\text{thresh} \in \{10^{-3}, 5 \times 10^{-4}\, 2.5 \times 10^{-4}}~\text{m/s}$ (**sea ice speed threshold**)

Fast ice is identified from sea ice concentration ($a$) and speed ($|\vec{u}|$) using multiple thresholding methods.

Since we are masking (thresholding) values that are two grids ($a$ is on the /T-grid/ and $\vec{u}$ is on the /B-grid/) we need to decide on either re-gridding $a$ to the /B-grid/ or $\vec{u}$ to the /T-grid/. Since the underlying landmask file that I have been using for simulation is based on the /T-grid/ I choose to re-grid $u$ and $v$ sea ice velocity components to the /T-grid/. Other established results ([Lemieux et.al](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JC012006) and [VanAchter et.al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2021.101920)) have used this same approach. However, to be thorough in my reporting and analysis I have chosen to preserve the non-re-gridded ice speeds and hence have created the following four sea ice speed categories.

### 1.1 `ispd` categories:

1. `ispd_B`  :: no re-gridding
2. `ispd_Ta` :: spatially-averaged
3. `ispd_Tx` :: spatially-weighted-average
4. `ispd_BT` :: composite-mean of `ispd_B`, `ispd_Ta` and `ispd_Tx`

#### 1.1.1 `ispd_B`

From [`ispd_B`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L228)

$$
|\vec{u}|_B = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}
$$

#### 1.1.2 `ispd_Ta`

From [`ispd_Ta`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L238)

To approximate the speed on the T-grid ($|\vec{u}|_T$), AFIM applies a spatial average of the B-grid speed $|\vec{u}|_B$ from the four surrounding corners:

$$
|\vec{u}|_T(i,j) = \frac{1}{4} \Big[ |\vec{u}|_B(i,j) + |\vec{u}|_B(i+1,j) + |\vec{u}|_B(i,j+1) + |\vec{u}|_B(i+1,j+1) \Big]
$$

This is equivalent to averaging the velocity magnitudes from the four B-grid corners around a T-grid center, mitigating the impact of single-point no-slip anomalies.

#### 1.1.3 `ispd_Tx`

From [`ispd_Tx`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/273090c740618e4db7a5d835e614fa855a9fc793/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L190)

More generally, this type of spatial interpolation is an instance of **bilinear interpolation**, a common spatial re-gridding method in numerical modeling. The bilinear interpolation at a point $(x, y)$ within a cell bounded by $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, with values $Q_{11}$, $Q_{21}$, $Q_{12}$, $Q_{22}$ at each corner, is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x, y) &= \frac{1}{(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)} \Big[ \\
&\quad Q_{11}(x_2 - x)(y_2 - y) + Q_{21}(x - x_1)(y_2 - y) \\
&\quad + Q_{12}(x_2 - x)(y - y_1) + Q_{22}(x - x_1)(y - y_1) \Big]
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression performs linear interpolation in $x$ followed by $y$, and provides smooth, continuous estimates across grid cells while not necessarily conserving quantities like mass or energy. More information on this specific method that I used can be obtained from [ESMF Regridding Documentation](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/regrid/) and [xESMF](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Compare_algorithms.html).

### 1.2 masking methods:

From the above four `ispd` categories there are then two temporal ways in which to apply the thresholding:
1. on daily-averaged $a$ and $\vec{u}$, **or**
2. N-day-average $\bar{a}$ and $\bar{\vec{u}}$
3. apply additional criteria (see section 1.3 below)

Then classify/mask for fast ice using:

$$
FImask_{ispd-cat} = \bar{a} \geq a_\text{thresh} \quad \text{and} \quad \bar{u} \leq u_\text{thresh}
$$
where $u_{\text{thresh}}$ is one of the four sea ice speed categories: `ispd_B`, `ispd_Ta`, `ispd_Tx`, or `ispd_BT`.

This results in eight different fast ice classifications (or conversely **pack ice** classifications). Hence my naming scheme I have chosen to use the following nomenclature for brevity and remaining consistent with the underlying sea ice speed categories:
1. `B`, `Ta`, `Tx`, `BT`                     :: **no** temporal-averaging of $a$ and $\vec{u}$
2. `B_roll`, `Ta_roll`, `Tx_roll`, `BT_roll` :: rolling-averaging of $N$-days on \bar{a}$ and $\bar{\vec{u}}$

An additional method for classifying fast ice was then proposed by @adfraser, and that is to use the daily-averaged $a$ and $\vec{u}$ to create: `FI_mask_B`, `FI_mask_Ta`, `FI_mask_Tx` or `FI_mask_BT`). 
* Boolean (or binary-days) approach:
1. take 

#### 1.2.1 daily-average method:
[Full method](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/273090c740618e4db7a5d835e614fa855a9fc793/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L434)

#### 1.2.2 rolling-average method:
More generally the N-day-average that [I employed](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/273090c740618e4db7a5d835e614fa855a9fc793/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L540) can be expressed as a rolling average over $N$-days (default $N=15$):

$$
\bar{a}(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\tau = t - N/2}^{t + N/2} a(\tau)
$$

### 1.3 Additional criteria imposed:

#### 1.3.1 re-apply landmask:
After either doing (or not doing the temporal averaging) the dataset is then sub-set for particular hemisphere: `north` or `south` (default `south`).

#### 1.3.2 hemisphere masking:
After either doing (or not doing the temporal averaging) the dataset is then sub-set for particular hemisphere: `north` or `south` (default `south`).

## 3. Daily vs. Rolling-Averaged Workflow

### 3.1 Daily Processing  
From [`process_daily_cice`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L434):
Masking is applied directly to daily fields.

### 3.2 Rolling Averaged Processing  
From [`process_rolling_cice`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L481):
A rolling average is applied before thresholding.

## 4. Fast Ice Metrics

Metrics are computed via [`compute_fast_ice_metrics.py`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/scripts/sea_ice_metrics/compute_fast_ice_metrics.py), with methods:

### 4.1 Fast Ice Area (FIA)  
From [`compute_fast_ice_area`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L620):

$$
\text{FIA}(t) = \sum_{i,j} A_{i,j} M_{i,j}(t)
$$
Where:
- $M_{i,j}(t)$ is the boolean fast ice mask
- $A_{i,j}$ is the grid cell area

### 4.2 Fast Ice Concentration (FIC)  
From [`compute_fast_ice_concentration`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L628):

$$
\text{FIC}_{i,j}(t) = M_{i,j}(t) \cdot a_{i,j}(t)
$$

### 4.3 Fast Ice Thickness (FIH)  
From [`compute_fast_ice_thickness`](https://github.com/dpath2o/AFIM/blob/main/src/sea_ice_processor.py#L636):

$$
\text{FIH}_{i,j}(t) = M_{i,j}(t) \cdot h_{i,j}(t)
$$

## 5. Threshold Sensitivity

AFIM supports experiments with multiple $u_\text{thresh}$ values:
- $10^{-3}~\text{m/s}$ (default)
- $5 \times 10^{-4}~\text{m/s}$ (for sensitivity testing)

These are applied to both boolean and rolling classifications.
